## Summary of Lab 10
Lab 10 begins by having the user create their own GitHub and forking a repository. I have already had a GitHub account for years so that part of the lab was already complete. For the second part of the lab, I forked the repository which contained the instructions and data for the lab. I learned to fork a repository by watching former Purdue students Yang Wang's Youtube video which was linked in the lab files for this lab. For the last part of the lab, we took a text file that contained a poem and wrote a code that would reverse the order of characters in the poem and write it to the user backward.

## Code Used in Lab 10
Part of the code was provided and edited by me to complete the objective laid out by the lab instructions. Linked below is the final code I used to write the poem backward.
