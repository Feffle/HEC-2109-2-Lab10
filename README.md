## Summary of Lab 10
Lab 10 begins by having the user create their own GitHub and forking a repository. I have already had a GitHub account for years so that part of the lab was already complete. For the second part of the lab, I forked the repository which contained the instructions and data for the lab. I learned to fork a repository by watching former Purdue students Yang Wang's Youtube video which was linked in the lab files for this lab. For the last part of the lab, we took a text file that contained a poem and wrote a code that would reverse the order of characters in the poem and write it to the user backward.

## Code Used in Lab 10
Part of the code was provided and edited by me to complete the objective laid out by the lab instructions. Linked below is the final code I used to write the poem backward.

## Conclusion
The start of the lab was fairly easy with the first two steps being simple and easy to complete. However, once I got to the third part, it became far harder with me having to tweak the code to complete the objective taking an arbitrary string and having it returned in a reverse order. To accomplish this, I had to turn the poem into a string and create an empty string line. Next, I created a loop that moved through each character as the text was being processed and had each letter processed to be added to an existing line causing the next letter to go backward. By returning this line, the text was completely backward and needed to be assigned to a variable name as well as printed for the user to see. The final variable for the reversed text was called backwardslongline and when printed displayed the poem in reversed glory. This part of the lab took lots of troubleshooting but after succeeding in finishing the objective given to me by the lab, I felt I had gained a better understanding of Python and Anaconda Assistant as well.
